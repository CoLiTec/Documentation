The first line contains the code-number of the observation point   
(in this case = 00000, Long = 30.75564 deg, Lat = 46.47778 deg, Alt = 56m) and  NORAD number of the object.
ATTENTION.  In positions 8-16: HHMMSSSSS, observation time (UTC) with THREE decimal positions of seconds! It is necessary for high angular velocity of LEO.

Positions 1-6: DDMMYY, observing date

Position 7: Space

Positions 8-16: HHMMSSSSS, observation time (UTC)

Position 17: Space

Positions 18-25: HHMMSSSS, right ascension in J2000 epoch in watchmaking terms (hours, minutes and seconds with decimal fractions)

Position 26: Space

Position 27: required sign of the declination (+ or -)

Positions 28-35: DDMMSSSS, declination in J2000 epoch in terms of degree (degrees, minutes, seconds, with decimal fractions)

Position 36: Space

Positions 37-39: Accuracy estimation of the measured position, an integer arcseconds, supplemented with leading zeros up to 3 digits

Positions 40-42: always is 000. Measurements of position have non-regular intervals. The brightness measurements have equal intervals = 0.02 s and are available separately.
